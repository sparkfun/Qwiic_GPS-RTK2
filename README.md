[*SparkFun GPS-RTK-SMA - ZED-F9P (GPS-16481)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16481)

The ZED-F9P module is the top-of-the-line module for high accuracy GNSS and GPS location solutions including RTK. The ZED-F9P is unique in that it can receive both L1 and L2 GPS bands as well as up to four constellations (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo) at the same time. This module is capable of 10mm positional accuracy and has survey-in mode allowing the module to become a base station and produce RTCM 3.x correction data. 

**Words, words, words. What does it look like?!** I'm glad you asked!
